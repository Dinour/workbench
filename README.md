## Workbench Docker Image

To make things easy use a shell script named ansible_helper that wraps a Docker image containing Ansible:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v ~/.ssh/id_rsa:/root/.ssh/id_rsa \
  -v ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub:/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \
  -v ~/.vault_pass.txt:/root/.vault_pass.txt \
  -v $(pwd):/ansible_playbooks \
  -v /var/log/ansible/ansible.log \
  walokra/ansible-playbook "$@"
```

Point the above script to any inventory file so that you can execute any Ansible command on any host, e.g.
```
./ansible_helper play playbooks/site.yml -i production --vault-password-file /root/.vault_pass.txt
```
